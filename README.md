# img2text-transfer-attn
img2text-transfer-attn is a modular image-captioning codebase for MS COCO. A pre-trained CNN encodes images into feature embeddings, which are decoded by either an LSTM or a Transformer with masked multi-head attention and positional encodings. Easily swap encoders or fine-tune layers.
